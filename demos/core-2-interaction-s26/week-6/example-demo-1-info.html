	Inline vs. block display
</h1>
<p>
	In normal flow, inline elements display in the direction words are displayed in a sentence (In English, it is horizontal).
</p>
<p>
	Block elements display one after the other vertically, starting at the top and moving down the page; a block element takes up the full width of its parent element.
