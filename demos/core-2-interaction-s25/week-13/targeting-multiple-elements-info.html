<h1>
	<span>Loops</span>
	document.querySelectorAll()
</h1>
<p>
	Weâ€™ll often want to target multiple elements using a specific rule rather than a single element. We can do this by using <strong class="info-code">document.querySelectorAll</strong>. This gives us an array of elements, instead of a single element like <span class="info-code">document.querySelector</span> does. We can then loop through that array to access each element.
