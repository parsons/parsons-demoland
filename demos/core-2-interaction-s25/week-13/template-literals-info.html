<p>
	On the top-left of your keyboard is the back tick symbol, which looks like this `. This symbol indicates the start and end of a <strong>template literal</strong>, which is a string that you can insert other snippets of code inside of. To add code inside of a template literal, use the notation <strong class="info-code">${}</strong> and write your code inside the curly brackets.
