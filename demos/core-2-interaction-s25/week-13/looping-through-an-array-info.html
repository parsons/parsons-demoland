	Looping Through an Array
</h1>
<p>
	We can use <span class="info-code">for</span> loops to access every entry in an array. We have two methods for doing this:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use the loop counter to track the index of the array we’re looking for.</li>
	<li>Use a <strong class="info-code">for...of</strong> loop. Each time the loop runs, you’ll have a variable that represents the next entry in the array.</li>
</ol>
