	By now, you’ve learned about most of the fundamental concepts of JavaScript (and actually of all programming languages)! What’s really cool about JavaScript is that we can use these simple fundamentals to make incredibly complex things.
</p>
<p>
	When people use JavaScript to accomplish complex tasks, they often release their code for others to use as well. To do so, they create <strong>JavaScript libraries</strong>, which are essentially just massive <span class="info-code">.js</span> files that includes unique functions.

	This demo uses the <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/" target="_blank">Tone.js</a> JavaScript library, which adds audio synthesis functionality to websites. Every library features its own documentation so that people can learn how to use it. Documentation can often be pretty hard to read, but luckily we don’t need to understand ALL of it to make use of a library. This demo features a fairly simple example of Tone.js used to add dynamic audio.
