	“while” Loops
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Loops</strong> allow us to run the same snippet of code multiple times instanteously. This is different from <span class="info-code">setInterval()</span> because loops run without a delay and don’t run infinitely many times.
</p>
<p>
	There are a few ways to create loops depending on the context and your preference. <strong class="info-code">while</strong> loops run until a specified condition is no longer true. As long as the condition is true, the loop will run forever.
</p>
<p>
	We often use loops with a <strong>counter</strong> variable of some sort. This variable tracks how many times the loop has run. We increase (a.k.a. <strong>increment</strong>) the counter by 1 each time the loop runs and end the loop when it reaches a specific number.
</p>
<p>
	WARNING: Avoid situations with infinite loops at all costs! These happen when the condition never becomes false. If that happens to you in DEMOLAND, you’ll have to close your browser tab and reopen the demo to fix it. To avoid an infinite loop, you’ll often want the following:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>A loop counter variable.</li>
	<li>A condition that checks the current value of your loop counter.</li>
	<li>A line of code that increments your loop counter each time the loop runs.</li>
</ol>
