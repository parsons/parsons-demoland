	Weekly Challenge: Wikipedia Randomizer
</h1>
<p>
	For this week’s challenge, you’ll be creating a website that acts like a tool for generating art. The user can interact with controls that adjust the parameters for this generative art. I’ve already started it for you, so here’s what you need to finish:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>STEP 1: The controls on this page are already coded, but they don’t work! Finish the event listeners so that each input element updates BOTH the <span class="info-code">settings</span> object, as well as the <span class="info-code">&lt;label&gt;</span> element next to it.</li>
	<li>STEP 2: Now, you have to add the settings to the correct places inside of the code. Start by adding the setting for <span class="info-code">numberOfArticles</span> into the URL for Wikipedia’s API. There is a TODO placeholder for where to add this setting.</li>
	<li>STEP 3: Add the remaining 3 settings to apply CSS to each element through JavaScript. Again, look for the TODOs in the code!</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I’ve added TODOs to the code to indicate where you should write your own code. <strong>Make sure to remove the full /* TODO */ text, otherwise you’ll be left with comments that ruin your code!</strong>
</p>
<p>
	If you’re looking for an optional challenge, here’s what else you can try:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add settings for other CSS properties.</li>
	<li>Make the generated links change color on hover and play music using Tone.js. Hint: look at the sneak peek from today’s class!</li>
	<li>Play with the CSS to change what the generative art looks like.</li>
</ul>
