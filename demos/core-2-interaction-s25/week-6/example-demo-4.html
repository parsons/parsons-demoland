<!-- This is a basic form. For it to actually work, we need a few other form attributes, a server to receive the responses, and some server-side code. -->
<form> 
	<div> <!-- You can nest elements within a form -->
	  <label for="inputid">My name is:</label> 
	  <!-- A label is an inline element like a span and is tied to the id attribute of the input element it is labelling. Strictly speaking, labels are not necessary but are good practice for accessibility. -->
	  <input type="text" id="inputid" name="inputid" />
	  <!-- This is an example of an input element. The type of input is indicated by the "type" attribute. The "id" is a unique identifier is used by the label and for targeting by JS or CSS. The "name" is sent to the server along with the value as a key-value pair. -->
	</div>
	<button type="submit">Submit This!</button>
	<!-- There are different button types. This one submits the form to the server. (However, in our demo, there is no server to receive this information.)-->
</form>
