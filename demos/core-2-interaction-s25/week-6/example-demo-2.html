	<title>Inline v. Block Display</title>

</head>
<body>
	<p>By default, most elements are block-level elements, meaning they take up the full width of their parent element. One inline-level element is the <span style="color: red;">span</span> element.</p>

	<p>However, any element can be set to block or inline using the display property!</p>

	<p style="display: inline;">Here is an inline paragraph.</p>
	<p style="display: inline; background-color: red;">And another inline paragraph! Note that this paragraph flows right after the previous paragraph</p>

	<span style="display: block;">And here is a block-level span tag. Because the display has been set to block, it stacks right below the previous element. Also note that block elements do not "break" apart onto the next line.</span>

	<p>Inline elements have some funny behaviors. <span style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">Here’s what happens when you apply padding and a border to an inline element.</span></p>

	<p>We can also create inline-block elements which have qualities of both inline and block elements. <span style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">Here’s a span tag turned into an inline-block element.</span> Notice how the border no longer overlaps the other text, and try to resize the page to see how the text looks when it wraps to another line.</p>

	<p>Finally, the display property can be used to remove an entire element from the page: <span style="display: none;">Like so!</span></p>

	<p>We'll learn more about why this is useful in Unit 3!</p>
