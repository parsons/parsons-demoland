<h1>
	<span>CSS</span>
	Inline v. Block Display
</h1>
<p>
	Most elements are displayed like blocks that fill the width of the parent container and stack on top of each other. Elements that modify text are displayed in a running fashion that allows the content within that element to wrap. 
	
	The display of <em>any element</em> can be altered by using the CSS <span class="info-code">display</span> property.
</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.php?filename=playcss_display" target="_blank">many different types</a> of display property values, some of which will be covered later this semester.</p>
