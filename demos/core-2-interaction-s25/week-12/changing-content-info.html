	<span>JavaScript</span>
	Changing Content
</h1>
<p>
	Last week, we looked at how to use JavaScript to change CSS. This week, we’re going to look at how to use it to change both CSS and HTML.
</p>
<p>
	We can change the text inside of an element by setting its <strong class="info-code">.textContent</strong> property to a new value. We can even write new HTML inside of an element by setting its <strong class="info-code">.innerHTML</strong> property to a new value.
</p>
<p>
	We’ll come back to this later today, but just remember it in the back of your head for now.
