	Arrays
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Arrays</strong> let us keep track of a whole bunch of data in a single variable. We start and end an array with square brackets and use commas to separate our data, and we can define an array over multiple lines of code. Arrays are actually their own data type, just like numbers, strings, and Booleans.
</p>
<p>
	To access data in an array, we say the arrayâ€™s name followed by an <strong>index</strong>. For example, <span class="info-code">console.log(arr1[0])</span> gives us the first entry in our array. Note that arrays are <strong>0-indexed</strong>, meaning that the first entry is actually the 0th entry.
