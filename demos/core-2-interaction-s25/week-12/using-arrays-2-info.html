	Arrays: Edge Cases
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Edge cases</strong> are instances where your code breaks because a number is 1 more or less than a valid value.
</p>
<p>
	If we encounter an edge case, we can usually fix it with something like an if/else statement. Weâ€™re checking if the index is equal to the length of our array by using <strong class="info-code">.length</strong>. This way, we can have as many entries in our array as we want and our code will still work.
