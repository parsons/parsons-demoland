<p>
	But we need to walk before we run. Those demos were a whole bunch of sneak peeks into what JavaScript can do. Let’s get started with the basics.
</p>
<p>
	In this demo, I’ve added some JavaScript to our HTML document by using the <strong class="info-code">&lt;script&gt;</strong> element. JavaScript has its own unique syntax different from HTML and CSS. The first thing to note is that in JavaScript, we usually end every line with a semicolon <span class="info-code">;</span>
</p>

<h2>Variables and data types</h2>
<p>
	This demo features several <strong>variables</strong>. Variables let us keep track of data and refer to it later on. There are several <strong>types</strong> of data we’re able to store. Here are the basics:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Numbers</strong> — either integers (rounded numbers) or floats (with decimals)</li>
	<li><strong>Strings</strong> — text, written in single or double quotes</li>
	<li><strong>Booleans</strong> — either true or false, written in lowercase without quotes</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We can <strong>define</strong> variables by using the <strong class="info-code">let</strong> keyword and giving our variable a name. Names must be one word without spaces. Once we’ve defined a variable, we can redefine it at any time.
</p>

<h2>Testing JavaScript</h2>
<p>
	Open the <strong>console</strong> by pressing the bottom-left button in the Editor panel. The console is your interface for testing JavaScript code. (BTW, this is a fake console I made just for the DEMOLAND site. There is also a real in-browser console, which you can access via the Inspect panel in your browser).
</p>
<p>
	Inside the console, try typing <span class="info-code">console.log(var1)</span>. We can use <strong class="info-code">console.log()</strong> to view the values of any variable we’ve already defined.
</p>
<p>
	Now try typing <span class="info-code">console.log(typeof(var1))</span>. We can use <strong class="info-code">typeof()</strong> to view the type of any value.
</p>
<p>
	Trying checking the values and types of all the variables in this demo. Any surprises? In the next demo, we’ll talk about the different <strong>operators</strong> we’re using for things like math and logic.
