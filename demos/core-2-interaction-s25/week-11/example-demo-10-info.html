<p>
	That was a pretty boring function. Let’s see a more useful (or at least fun) one.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conditionals</strong> (a.k.a. <strong>if else statements</strong>) check if a value (a Boolean) is true or false. In this function, we’re checking if a word is too long. Why? Because we can do whatever we want with functions, so why not!
