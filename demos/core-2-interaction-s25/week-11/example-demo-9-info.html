	Functions
</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Functions</strong> let us run an chunk of code all at once. We can reuse functions with different inputs, which we call either <strong>arguments</strong> or <strong>parameters</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	We define a function by doing the following:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Start by writing <span class="info-code">function</span> followed by the function’s name. This can be whatever you want as long as it’s one word without punctuation.</li>
	<li>In parentheses, define one or more arguments separated by commas. These are like variables that are only available inside of your function.</li>
	<li>In curly brackets, write as much code as you want! And then if you want your function to output something, you can use the <strong class="info-code">return</strong> keyword followed by a value.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	We can <strong>call</strong> (i.e. run) a function by writing its name and feeding it some values.
