<h1>
	<span>JavaScript</span>
	Modifying CSS
</h1>
<p>
	Now let’s move on to some fun *visual* stuff.
</p>
<p>
	In this demo, we’re using JavaScript to change the CSS styles of our element. Here’s how we do that:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>First, we need to assign our element to a variable like before.</li>
	<li>Then, we set <strong class="info-code">.style.__propertyName__</strong> equal to something to change its value.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This works for any CSS property. BUT, because we can’t use hyphens (-) in JavaScript since they mean subtraction, we have to use <strong>camelCase</strong> notation instead. So, a property like <span class="info-code">background-color</span> would become <span class="info-code">backgroundColor</span>.
