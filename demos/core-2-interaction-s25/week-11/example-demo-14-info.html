	Toggling Classes
</h1>
<p>
	Changing CSS so far has required a whole bunch of lines of code. What if we just want to add or remove classes?
</p>
<p>
	This is actually really easy! We can use <strong class="info-code">.classList</strong> to add, remove, or toggle classes. <strong>Toggling</strong> a class just means adding it if the element doesnâ€™t already have it, or removing it if the element does have the class.
